Invitational Code Instructions

I recommend moving all of these files into a folder, and then opening the folder in VS Code.

This code uses Python, and .csv files. 

There are some imports that are necessary:
- re
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy

Process Beforehand:
The large spreadsheet file was reformatted slightly manually in VS Code, to fix spacing for readability. I can't attach the file because I've reached the file limit ;-;
Tournaments and events themselves were separated using Excel scripts
The code relies on the smaller .csv files for each tournament

Another note, the team_breakdown() has a graph displaying "strategy", because I believe that some events are structured differently within each subject.
